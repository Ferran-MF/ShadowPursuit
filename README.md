## About the project
Shadow Pursuit it's a typical backroom game where you have to escape the maze while an entity chases you and tries to kill you. It's the first time I've made a game in Unity so it's possible that there will be bugs and things to improve. But with the time spent and the lack of knowledge, I'm quite satisfied with the game.

## Game design document
Before I started programming the game I made a file compiling the idea of the game as well as assets and functionalities that I wanted it to have, this document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWAdIQzPke30ur35ZB7AAJZJb8T3kqzFJO6r-J3zJ5o/edit?usp=drive_link).

## User guide
If you enter the game without any information you may get lost, or you may not know where to go or how to interact with the objects, to help you I have made the following user manual with controls and other things:
